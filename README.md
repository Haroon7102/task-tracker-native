Project Overview
MyWheels is a mobile application built as a beginner's first React Native project. The primary goal of the app is to assist users in tracking vehicle maintenance tasks, such as oil changes, tire rotations, or service appointments, by providing timely reminders. Beyond vehicle maintenance, the app also serves as a general task management tool, allowing users to create, update, and delete tasks with deadlines.
The app uses token-based authentication to ensure secure user access. Once registered, users can sign in, manage their tasks, and receive notifications when a task's due time approaches. The name "MyWheels" reflects the app's focus on vehicle-related reminders, symbolizing the importance of keeping your vehicle "rolling" smoothly.
This project is a great starting point for those learning React Native and Node.js, as it covers essential concepts like API integration, state management, and mobile notifications.
Features

Tech Stack

Frontend:
React Native: For building the cross-platform mobile application.
React Navigation: For handling navigation between screens.
Axios: For making HTTP requests to the backend.
React Native Push Notification: For implementing push notifications.


Backend:
Node.js: For building the server-side application.
Express.js: For creating RESTful APIs.
MongoDB: For storing user and task data.
JSON Web Tokens (JWT): For token-based authentication.
Bcrypt: For hashing user passwords.


Tools & Utilities:
Git: For version control.
npm: For package management.
Expo CLI: For easier React Native development and testing.



Getting Started
Follow the instructions below to set up and run the MyWheels application locally.
Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:

Node.js (v16 or higher)
npm (v8 or higher)
MongoDB (local or cloud instance, e.g., MongoDB Atlas)
Expo CLI (npm install -g expo-cli)
React Native development environment (follow React Native setup guide)
An Android/iOS emulator or physical device for testing

Installation

Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/task-tracker-native.git
cd task-tracker-native


Install Backend Dependencies:Navigate to the backend directory and install dependencies.
cd backend
npm install


Install Frontend Dependencies:Navigate to the frontend directory and install dependencies.
cd ../frontend
npm install


Set Up Environment Variables:

In the backend directory, create a .env file and add the following:MONGO_URI=your-mongodb-connection-string
JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret-key
PORT=5000


In the frontend directory, create a .env file (if needed) for API URL:API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api





Running the Backend

Start the MongoDB server (if running locally).
In the backend directory, run:npm start


The backend server will run on http://localhost:5000.

Running the Frontend

In the frontend directory, start the Expo development server:npm start


Use the Expo Go app on your mobile device or an emulator to scan the QR code and launch the app.

Usage
Once the app is running, you can use the following features:
Registering a User

Open the app and navigate to the Register screen.
Enter your email, password, and any other required details.
Submit the form to create a new account.

Signing In

On the Sign In screen, enter your registered email and password.
Upon successful authentication, you'll be redirected to the task dashboard.

Managing Tasks

Create a Task:
Click the "Add Task" button.
Enter the task title, description, and due date/time.
Save the task to add it to your list.


Update a Task:
Select an existing task from the list.
